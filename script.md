# **Eve Demo Script - HackPrinceton 2025**

## **Opening (30 seconds)**

**"Hi everyone! I'm excited to show you Eve — Your Everyday Virtual Executive. Eve is an AI-powered assistant that analyzes your audio and video recordings to extract actionable insights, tasks, and emotional intelligence.**

**Today I'll show you three things:**
1. **Smart task extraction from audio**
2. **Video analysis with GPT-4o Vision**
3. **Emotional intelligence powered by Amazon Bedrock**

**Let's start with audio."**

---

## **Part 1: Audio Task Extraction (2-3 minutes)**

**[Switch to Audio mode]**

**"First, let me record a quick meeting note with a checklist."**

**[Start recording]**

**"Hey team, quick update. I need to finish the HackPrinceton demo by Friday. Also, remember to email Professor Smith about the project deadline — that's due next Monday. Oh, and we should schedule a team meeting for next week to discuss the presentation. Finally, don't forget to review the code changes before we push to production."**

**[Stop recording]**

**"Watch what happens..."**

**[Wait for processing, then show results]**

**"Eve extracted four actionable tasks:**
- **Finish HackPrinceton demo by Friday**
- **Email Professor Smith about project deadline (Monday)**
- **Schedule team meeting next week**
- **Review code changes before production push**

**It captured due dates, assigned owners, and context — all automatically."**

**[Show dropdown menu]**

**"Eve adapts to different contexts. For example:**
- **Interview Practice** — gives feedback on your answers
- **Coffee Chat** — extracts career tips and follow-ups
- **Lecture/Study** — creates study materials and flashcards
- **General Meeting** — standard task extraction

**Let's switch to video analysis."**

## **Part 2: Video Analysis - Logistic Regression Lecture (3-4 minutes)**

**[Switch to Video mode, select "Lecture/Study" context]**

**"Now let's analyze a lecture. I'll use a recording of my professor explaining logistic regression."**

**[Upload/record video]**

**[While processing, explain]**

**"Eve uses GPT-4o Vision to analyze video frames. It:**
- **Extracts key scenes** from the video
- **Reads slides** using OCR
- **Detects what's happening** visually
- **Generates a visual summary** of the content

**[Show results when ready]**

**"Look at this analysis:**
- **9 key scenes identified** — the system scales based on video length
- **Slide content extracted** — all the text from the presentation
- **Visual summary** — 'The user appears to be viewing a presentation about logistic regression with mathematical formulas and data visualizations visible'

**This is pure visual analysis — no audio needed for the frame understanding."**

**[Click "Generate Smart Analysis"]**

**"Now let's get deeper insights..."**

**[Show coaching insights, summary, tasks]**

**"Eve generated:**
- **Summary** — main topics covered
- **Strengths** — what you understood well
- **Knowledge gaps** — areas to review
- **Tasks** — study items extracted from the lecture

**Let's use the AI practice feature."**

**[Click "Practice with AI"]**

**"I can ask questions about the lecture..."**

**[Type/ask]: "Can you explain the difference between linear and logistic regression?"**

**[Show AI response]**

**"The AI uses the transcript and analysis to answer contextually. Let me ask one more..."**

**[Ask another question]**

**"This creates an interactive study session from any lecture recording."**

## **Part 3: Emotional Intelligence - Cornell Professor Lecture (3-4 minutes)**

**[Switch to new video]**

**"Now for something interesting. I'll analyze a famous lecture where a Cornell professor reacts to a student yawning. This shows our emotional intelligence features."**

**[Upload video]**

**[While processing]**

**"This video is perfect because it has clear emotional dynamics. Eve uses Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3 Haiku to analyze emotional content."**

**[Show results]**

**"Look at the Amazon Bedrock Emotional Analysis:**
- **Overall Vibe: Frustrated/Anxious** — detected the professor's reaction
- **Interest Level: Disengaged** — identified the student's lack of engagement
- **Emotional Moments:**
  - 'Professor shows visible frustration when student yawns'
  - 'Tension increases as the interaction continues'
- **Evidence:**
  - Direct quotes showing the emotional shift
  - Interpretation of what these signals mean

**This is the core feature — understanding not just what people say, but how they feel and whether they're engaged."**

**[Show task extraction from video]**

**"Eve also extracted tasks from the video:**
- **'Address student engagement issues'**
- **'Review lecture pacing'**
- **'Follow up on classroom dynamics'**

**This shows Eve can extract actionable insights from emotional content, not just transcripts."**
